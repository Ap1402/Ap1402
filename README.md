I'm a computer engineer that also likes seeing documentaries, learning random things, languages, translating Japanese and listening to music.
I'm mostly interested in backend development and everything related to that field, I'm happy learning how things work under the hood. 

## What I'm currently interested in?:
* Cloud Computing
* Everything related to system administration
* Networks
* AI
